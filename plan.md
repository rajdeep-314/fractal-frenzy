# Plan


## Manim portion (Raagam)

A general overview:

- Koch snowflake
- Vicsek fractal



## Pygame portion (Rajdeep)


- Basic pygame stuff
    - set_as
    - drawing a circle using set_as, just as a demo
    - saving the surface as an image

- Sierpinski triangle
    - generating and plotting points for it
    - circular gradient
    - saving an image

- T cross fractal
    - generating and plotting points for it
    - circular gradient
    - saving an image

- Mandelbrot set
    - a boolean in_set function
    - a black and white mandelbrot set
    - generating "k-factor" values for the fractal
    - a few color maps


Some notes to self:

- `utils.py` will be pre-made but it's functions will be explained as their need arises
